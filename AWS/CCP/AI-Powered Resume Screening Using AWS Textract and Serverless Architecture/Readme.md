# Resume Screener Project

**AI-Powered Resume Screening Using AWS Textract and Serverless Architecture**

---

## Project Overview

This project is a fully serverless resume screening tool built with AWS services. It automatically extracts text from resumes, checks for key job-related skills, scores them, stores results in a database, and notifies the recruiter‚Äîwithout any manual intervention.

It is designed especially for **Startups, SMEs, NGOs**, or any organization that cannot afford expensive **ATS** platforms.

---

## Key Features

- Text extraction using **Amazon Textract**
- Serverless processing with **AWS Lambda**
- Resume storage in **Amazon S3**
- Keyword-based scoring logic (e.g., "AWS", "Python", "Certified")
- Data storage in **Amazon DynamoDB**
- Notifications via **Amazon SNS**
- Structured resume metadata output (JSON)

---

## Why This Project?

Recruiters spend hours manually scanning resumes. Existing ATS systems are expensive and often inaccessible to smaller companies.

This project provides:
- A low-cost, scalable solution
- A fair and standardized way to screen resumes
- Easy integration with existing hiring processes
